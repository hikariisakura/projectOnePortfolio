         <p>
            I was born in Guangzhou, China. During the age of 7, I moved to California, United States. 
            Art has always been a passion of mine as I love drawing and creating items.
            I also enjoy reading romance, listening to music, and watching videos during my free time.
            I am an advid enjoyer of anime that I tend to have a habit of reading manga, or danmei before I go to sleep each night.
            The kinds of music I love to listen to is Jpop, Cpop and Kpop especially while I work. 
            I am obsesseed with everything pastel and cute.
