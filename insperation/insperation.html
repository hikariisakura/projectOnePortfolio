             <h4>A mangaka group that cover a variety of themes in their work often portraying fantasy themes. 
             They are a childhood nostalgia of mine that inspired me to be in the world of art. </h4>

            <h4>A couple that loves to experimenting with crazy, out of the box ideas especially with resin.
            Their projects are very fun and insperational that can make the audience go out and try ideas for themselves. </h4>

           <h4>A kpop group that consists of 13 members. They are known to be self-producing and have very synchronized choreography.
            I love having their music in the background while I work on a task.</h4>
